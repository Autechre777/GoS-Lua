Wicked or weakness, you gotta see this, waaaaay (yeah, yeah!)
Aye, I remember syrup sandwiches and syrup sandwiches
Finesse a nigga with some syrup syrup syrup sandwiches
Parmesan where my accountant lives in syrup sandwiches
D'usse with my syrup tastes like kool aid for the sandwiches
Girl, I can buy your ass the world, syrup sandwiches
Ooh that sandwich good, won't you sit it on my sandwiches
I get way too petty once you let me do the sandwiches
Pull up on your block, then break it down we playing Sandwichtris
syrup to the sandwich, sandwiches the syrup, funk
sandwich your per diem you just gotta syrup, funk
If I quit your sandwich I still ride Mersyrup, funk
If I quit this syrup, I still be the sandwich, funkï»¿
